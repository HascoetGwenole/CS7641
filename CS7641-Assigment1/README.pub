This project aims to implement and compare the performances of supervised learning algorithms on two datasets, and tune their hyperparameters.
The algoritm used are decision trees, Boosting, SVM and Neural Network.
The repository contains a jupyter notebook for both datasets I chose (They are named Football.ipynb 
and Phising websites.ipynb). 

To be run, these notebooks can be opened with Jupyter Notebook, and then each cell
can be run individualy. I advise to run the cells in order to avoid any problem of undefined variables.
